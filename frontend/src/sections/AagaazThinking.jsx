          The Thought Behind

        </h2>

        <p>
          <span className="highlight-word">AAGAAZ</span> represents the beginning —
          the <strong>first spark before the battle</strong>, the first roar before
          the crowd erupts, and the first step toward excellence. As the first sports
          event of the year at our University, <span className="highlight-word">AAGAAZ</span>
          sets the energy and attitude for everything that follows.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where <strong>preparation transforms into performance</strong> and
          passion turns into action. <span className="highlight-word">AAGAAZ</span> brings
          together athletes who are ready to push limits, challenge rivals, and rise
          under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than just a competition, <span className="highlight-word">AAGAAZ</span> is a
          statement. It stands for unity, sportsmanship, and the fearless spirit of
          starting strong. It marks the launch of a year driven by discipline,
          determination, and unforgettable sporting moments.
        </p>

        <p className="legacy-line">
          AAGAAZ is not just the beginning of an event — it is the beginning of a legacy.
